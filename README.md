JUST IN CASE:

If it is not obviously, please run composer install to make sure the autoloader is set up  properly and you get the vendor file needed for this all to work. 

There is nothing really special to worry about, everything is kinda straight forward.

Suprisingly enough, I do not own a cat.. nor do I really like them. But this is the first idea I had.   
CSS and HTML all written or modified by me.  


Home Screen involves a simple join so it shows all the cats activity, after the project is turned in, may make it   
where the can post statuses about how their cats are doing, and maybe a messaging apllication to just play around.  

Cats is the page where you can insert a new type of cat and rate it yourself for how cute it is ect. No   
ID is alike, but anything else can be similar. 

Cuteness just shows the ranking of the cats on the site.  

Images is where users can import pictures of their cats, will either update an   
old picture or insert a new one if it is their first time uploading one.
